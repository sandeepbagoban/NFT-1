          <p>YokaiVerse is a collection of 9,000 generative Yokais with hundred of elements inspired by the Japan

          <p>Each artwork is original, with its own color palette and creation. The objective was to make each Yokai

                  <p>Emperor Sutoku, feared in life, more so in death, is one of the most famous Yokai to haunt Japan.
                    Unyielding, undying, his body did not decay after his death, and when he was finally cremated his
                    ashes formed a formidable cloud in the sky, mingling with the storm that heralded the end of his
                    physical body. The bringer of storms, plagues, etc., Sutoku is the harbinger of disaster - claiming
                    vengeance on those who wronged him in life, and their descendants. He still seeks to claim Japan for
                    himself, seeing it as rightfully is, even in death, and he continues to haunt the country as one of
                    the ‘Three Great Onryō’.</p>

                  <h1>Jorōgumo</h1>
                  <p>A solitary creature in the shape of a stunningly beautiful woman, the Jorōgumo entices her victims
                    with her feminine wiles; which is why her name translates to ‘entangling bride’ or ‘whore spider’ as
                    was the original meaning. Cunning, intelligent and ruthless, the Jorōgumo view humans as little more
                    than flies to entice into their webs to feed upon, especially foolish men, and women in this more
                    modern society. A gifted shapeshifter, she uses her ability to disguise herself as a woman to
                    attract her prey, ensnaring them in her silk threads stronger than steel, allowing her to slowly
                    devour her meal with her powerful venom. She is also able to summon thousands of fire-breathing
                    spiders, should she need to rid herself of any meddling fools wishing to try and harm her.</p>

                  <h1>Yūrei</h1>
                  <p>Yūrei are as unique as the deceased person they came from. Upon death the Yūrei retain the features
                    and clothing the person had upon their death, though their clothes and features may look more
                    disheveled in their now translucent forms. For those who died a particularly bloody death, their
                    wounds will be apparent as well, but all Yūrei hang their heads in such a way that their hair
                    obscures their faces, and they glide through graveyards or houses, or other places near to where
                    they died, with the hands held limply before them, no feet visible as they glide about, haunting one
                    particular place or person, usually where they died, a particular loved one or possibly the person
                    who killed them. Yūrei may look harmless, if a little frightening, but they are capable of powerful
                    curses, and they tend to remain if they have something left over from life that needs to be achieved
                    - their killer brought to justice, or passing a message to a loved one, for others they simply
                    cannot accept their own demise.</p>

                  <h1>Daitengu</h1>
                  <p>The Greater Tengu often have their own individual names which they prefer to go by, they appear
                    more human-like though they still sport the Tengu’s typically red face and phallic nose - the longer
                    the nose, the more powerful the Tengu. Dressed as monks, with large feathered wings, they can
                    transform into an avian form but choose to do so less often than the lesser Tengu. They are a
                    solitary creature, spending most of their time meditating and focussing on their intellect, which
                    makes them all the more dangerous. Extremely powerful and savage, they can be just as unpredictable
                    as other Tengu, but coupled with their wisdom they are far more terrifying adversaries. They are,
                    however, more restrained and give worthy human’s aid when asked, seen more as wise sages than the
                    monsters their lesser, more aggressive brethren are often seen as.</p>

                  <h1>Oni</h1>
                  <p>Oni are some of the more well known Yokai. These huge beasts, often translated as ogre or demon,
                    stand taller than most men and come in many varieties, though the most well known have either red or
                    blue skin and shocking, wild black hair with horns jutting from their heads, and huge yellowing
                    fang-like tusks that overlap their mouths. The number of horns, eyes, fingers and toes differ from
                    Oni to Oni, but all wear loincloths made from the pelts of great beasts slaughtered by their own
                    hands. They possess great strength and stamina, and despite their appearance are in fact
                    accomplished sorcerers. They are known to punish the damned in Hell, where they reside or in caves
                    on mountainsides, ready to find new victims. They are created when truly wicked humans die, and are
                    transformed into Oni in Hell, to punish and create new Oni when new souls arrive. They are well
                    known for being villainous creatures that bring about many natural disasters.</p>

                  <h1>Kappa</h1>
                  <p>Appearing as reptilian-humanoids, these ‘river children’ are most at home in the water. They appear
                    much like children in size, but don’t be fooled by their small stature, they are as strong as any
                    grown man. With scaled skin ranging from deep, earthy green to bright red or blue, the Kappa’s
                    webbed feet are built for swimming through the water at high speeds. With a shell on their backs and
                    a turtle-like beak, their appearance is often preceded by the intense smell of rotting fish due to
                    their elasticated skin, which can apparently be removed. The tops of their heads dip inward like a
                    dish, and as they appear above the surface it collects water, this strange dish is the source of
                    their power - should the water be spilled or dry up, they will be rendered immobile or possibly even
                    die. As young they remain in groups, but as adults they become more solitary, though they are not
                    opposed to pairing with other Yokai or people. They are extremely intelligible, and can speak any
                    language; if you can befriend one they can be loyal and loving, if mischievous and their proud
                    natures mean they will never break a promise. Kappa are also known for becoming violent, however,
                    taking their mischief too far and drowning people in order to eat them, on land you may be able to
                    outwit a Kappa into bowing to you in order to spill their water, but in water you’re doomed.</p>

                  <p>These mischievous ‘racoon dogs’ are extremely powerful, magical beings. They are extremely agile,
                    and well known for their cheerful, jovial nature and love of playing pranks on people. Able to
                    shape-shift at will, they love to change into people or other creatures in order to play their
                    tricks. The oddest thing about a Tanuki is their massive testicles, which they can manipulate at
                    will and adapt to whatever they require - they are known for creating fishing nets, umbrellas,
                    drums, fans and even weapons from them and their testicles are usually incorporated into their
                    disguises. Should they become a shopkeeper, it is their testicles that become the shop or a cart.
                    They are not a vicious creature, they are playful by nature and often viewed as cute pranksters who
                    mean little to no harm in reality. That’s not to say a few haven’t turned from the playful pranks to
                    more malicious ones on occasion, but their love of human life such as gambling and drinking means
                    they don’t tend to want ill-will pushed their way.</p>

                  <p>Not to be mistaken for a common fox, the Kitsune are extremely powerful magic beings. More commonly
                    known for being mischief makers, the wild foxes are famous for their pranks, they like to trick or
                    possess humans for fun, causing them to act strangely. Despite the wild foxes' somewhat evil nature,
                    even they keep their promises and remember friendships, they all repay their debts. The lesser known
                    Kitsune are the Holy foxes, servants of the Shinto deity Inari. They protect the shrines and act as
                    messengers for the gods, protecting humans and places while providing good luck and keeping away
                    evil spirits. Almost the polar opposite of their wild fox kin. Extremely intelligent and powerful,
                    Kitsune are known for punishing the wicked, creating horrible nightmares to scare, or tricking them
                    into humiliating situations as punishment. Some Kitsune prefer to spend their time in a human form,
                    on occasion they have been known to accidentally wed a human and live a fairly ordinary life, only
                    really exposed when drunk or startled into revealing their fangs or a patch of fur. Though most
                    prefer to stick to their mischievous nature, earning all foxes (magical or otherwise) a reputation
                    for trouble.</p>

                  <p>Where most humans are unable to see Yokai, until it’s too late, this particular clan have been
                    blessed with the ability to see them, and also gives them the skills to exterminate the Yokai. The
                    clan are little more than a rumour, operating from the shadows to protect the rest of the world from
                    the Yokai menace. They are all women; an apprentice is usually taken into the clan when a Master
                    sees a girl with the potential to hunt Yokai. The girls are trained, taught to sense the various
                    Yokai, and how to kill each one. They are ranked based on their abilities, receiving a magatama to
                    show how powerful they are, starting with one before becoming a Master with three. They are required
                    to take part in rituals, drinking a powerful potion that helps them to acquire new skills that aid
                    them in destroying their foes. Similar to the Samurai, the Hunters follow a set code of honour;
                    those who go against this are quickly shunned from the clan.</p>

          <p>This roadmap outlines our goals and where we want to take YokaiVerse. We have a lot of ideas and concepts
            that we are working on. It may evolve over time and hopfully become even better!</p>

            <h1>Phase 1: Kodai (Sale of NFT Yokais)<span>The goal is to have the coolest and highest quality first drop possible. 
              The date of the drop will be revealed as soon as we are fully satisfied with the quality of our
              work. Yokaiverse will be the first 3D Neon GIF NFT project. Now it remains to be seen which clan 
              you would belong to among the many yokai bases. </span></h1>

               directly distributed by YokaiVerse at a date to be revealed later. Expect to be surprised and 
               discover stories that are sometimes joyful, sometimes terrifying!</span></h1>

            <h1>Phase 3: Kinsei (Creation of the fighting game NFTs)<span>The third phase will aim to make the NFTs
              even more useful by providing the Yokai Origins NFTs, which will be the mix  oftraditional, 
              ancestral-design and digital painting. These NFT will be used in the Phase 5 fighting game. 
              You will receive the Yokai corresponding to your clan.</span></h1>

            <h1>Phase 4: Kindai (Creation of the first Yokaiverse novel)<span>The goal is to include all the Yokais
               in this initiative by writing a story that is inspired by the japanese folklore and following the 
               adventure of a young character who will be revealed and who, not surprisingly, has already been teased </span></h1>

            <h1>Phase 5: Gendai (Release of the fighting game)<span>This last phase will aim to put the yokai into action 
              with the creation of a fighting game. Only the owners of Yokai Origins will be able to access this video game
               and the primary objective will be to develop a competitive scene of the game to include various rewards with 
               partnerships. </span></h1>

              The lore from the previous phases has laid the foundations of the Yokaiverse universe and will be of great use
               in the development of the manga and anime, which will be made with Japanese artists and bring the Yokais to life.</span></h1>
